## Setup
1. Install `R` (the programming language) **and** `RStudio` (an Integrated
   Development Environment) from:
   [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop)

2. Open `RStudio` and install the `tidyverse` packages by executing the
   following code in your Console (located at bottom of window):

   ``` R
   # Installation will take some time
   install.packages("tidyverse")
   library(tidyverse)
   ```

3. A bioprocess dataset will be shared separately via McGill's SharePoint.
   Please keep it private. When ready, the link will be posted here.
